# C language style guide

## Indentation

- Use spaces instead of tabs.
- The indentation size is four spaces.
- Indent `case` labels.
- Do not put multiple statements on a single line.
- Do not put multiple assignments on a single line.
- Do not leave whitespace at the end of lines.

## Wrapping

- The line limit is 80 characters.
- Split long strings to meet the character limit.

## Bracing

- Every brace (`{`) or brace-semicolon pair (`};`) should have its own line,
  except during empty initialization or during array initialization when all array
  items are placed on a single line.
- Always use braces with control structures, even when optional.
- Separate functions and control structures by exactly one blank line.

## Spacing

Defer to the Linux Kernel Coding Style
[Section 3.1: Spacing](https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/v4.10/process/coding-style.html)
for spacing considerations.

## Naming

- Use `UPPER_SNAKE_CASE` for global constants, constant macros, and enumeration
  members.
- Use `PascalCase` for struct names, enumeration names, and type definitions.
- Use `lower_snake_case` for global functions.
- Use `lowercase` for static functions.
- Use `camelCase` for local variables, struct fields, and function arguments.

Always use descriptive names. Abbreviated names are forbidden except in the
following approved use cases. If a value is arbitrary, use the corresponding
abbreviation based on its type. If several values are abitrary, begin with the
corresponding type-based abbreviation and continue alphabetically. If doing so
is impractical, use numeric suffixes instead.

## Type definitions

- Always use type definitions for enumeration types.
- Always use type definitions to obscure pointers to structs.

### Macros

- Only use macros to define constants.
- When multiple related integer constants are defined, use an enumeration
  instead.
